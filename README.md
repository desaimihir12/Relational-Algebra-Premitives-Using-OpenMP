# Relational-Algebra-Premitives-Using-OpenMP
This is a repository for the OpenMP based implementations of relational abgebra primitives and to find the Transitive closure of a graph.
* Course : CS301 High Performance Computing
* Instructor : Prof. Bhaskar Chaudhury
* Problem : 7
* Team Name : The Four Horsemen
## Directories
* Codes - contains the serial and parallel implementation of the algorithms alogn with the various auxilary pieces of codes used
* DataSet - contains the test cases in .csv format used for comaprision of the serial and parallel algorithm. These are the directed graphs from [this site](https://sparse.tamu.edu/) which are used as test cases.
